This is the realization of a virtual HVAC unit through VHDL coding language.
Note that the credit for file HVAC.vhd and segment7_mux.vhd goes entirely to Trevor Smouter.

The rest of the file were created and tested by the collaboration of Chengfeng Deng and Tasviq Hossain, from the ECE 2026 of the University of Waterloo.

The Circuit Diagram was provided by the department of electrical and computer engineering, course group ECE-124 Digital Circuit and Systems.

Files that are provided in this project are being used with no intention of profit, this is only an exhibit of my personal coding skill.

Enjoy!
